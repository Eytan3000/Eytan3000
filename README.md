### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Eytan, a Full-Stack developer. <br /> <br />
ðŸŽµ Fun fact: My previous job was to expertly squash vegetables in front of a microphone to replicate sound effects for films. <br /> <br />
âš¡ My journey into coding began about two years ago when I decided to dive into JavaScript. This has turned into a profound love for programming. <br /> <br />
ðŸ’» Today I create robust human-centered solutions at Mepo. <br /> <br />
ðŸš€ I'm constantly engaged in personal projects.<br /> <br />
ðŸ¥ž My stack: JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Redux, NodeJS, ExpressJS, and MySQL. <br />

### Hi there 👋

<!--
**Eytan3000/Eytan3000** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

👋 Hey there! I'm Eytan, a Full-Stack developer. Currently, I'm dedicated to building human-centered products at Mepo, where I collaborate with a team of professionals to solve real-world problems.
💻 In my day-to-day work, I leverage my expertise in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Redux, NodeJS, ExpressJS, and MySQL to create robust and user-friendly solutions.
⚡ My journey into coding began about two years ago when I decided to dive into JavaScript. This has turned into a profound love for programming.
🚀 I'm constantly engaged in personal projects.
🎵 Fun fact: In my previous job, I was the guy that squashes vegetables in front of a microphone to reacreat sound effects for films.

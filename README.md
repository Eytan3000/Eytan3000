### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Eytan, a Full-Stack developer. <br /> <br />
ðŸ’» In my day-to-day work, I leverage my expertise in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Redux, NodeJS, ExpressJS, and MySQL to create robust solutions at Mepo. <br />
ðŸŽµ Fun fact: My previous job was to expertly squash vegetables in front of a microphone to replicate sound effects for films. <br />
âš¡ My journey into coding began about two years ago when I decided to dive into JavaScript. This has turned into a profound love for programming. <br />
ðŸš€ I'm constantly engaged in personal projects.<br />
